## Architecture.

Java Source Code File -> .class File -> Executed by Windows JVM 
                                     -> Executed by Linux JVM
                                     -> Executed by Mac JVM
Advantage, we need not share source code.


.cpp file -> Machine Code ( OS Dependent)
The Machine code, here cannot be used on different OS.


JDK- Used to develop Java Software.. (For Developers)
JVM- Used to Run Java Software by end users.


JRE Contains JVM plus other tools to run Java software
(Usually for End users)
